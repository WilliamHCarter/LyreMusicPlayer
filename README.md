## Overview

This music player was created as a cleaner, more album-focused approach to the music listening experience. Discovery options and playlists generated by other users are separated from the main tab in order to put a spotlight on the users album library. This project also served as good practice for creating complex animations on the frontend. Astro and SolidJS were chosen for this site as the fine-grained reactice approach of SolidJS makes working with webapps more streamlined as opposed to React.
